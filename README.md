# Pig game project

A dice game between two players. Each players get chances to roll the dice until he/she rolls 1. Rolling 1 ends the player's turn. The score in one turn keeps adding until the player rolls 1, which resets the current score. The players can hold the score which will increment his total score. The first player to reach 100 points in total wins the game.
